# .github is an organization-wide set of community standards for issues, PRs, etc.

## Label System

_Inspired by the article [Sane GitHub Labels](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63)_

This organization makes use of a consistent label system, as outlined below.

We're using [git-labelmaker](https://github.com/himynameisdave/git-labelmaker) to manage labels.

### Status

Use only one status label at a time.

- Abandoned
- Approved
- Blocked
- On Hold
- In Progress
- Resolved
- Review Needed
- Revision Needed
- Wontfix

### Type

You may use more than one type label at a time. 

- Bug. Something isn't working correctly.
- Maintenance. Keeping up with deps and etc.
- Enhancement. Making it better.
- Question. Add this label to get an answer.

### Priority

Use only one priority label at a time. 

- Critical. When an issue or PR is important and timely. Use sparingly.

If we find a need for more levels of priority as time goes on, we will add them, but for now we're keeping it simple.
